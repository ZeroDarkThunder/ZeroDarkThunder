Moin Moin, I'm Tyler Italiano

I am a Hacker for hire. I have a masters degree in Cyber Security, graduated eight months early from a two year program in Germany, I have won challenge coins at Defcon 32 for an oustanding individual performance. I have been coding for 11 years and my expertise is in social engineering and malware authoring but I'm happy to execute on any objective, given the right price. ;p

I have worked as a software and security engineer in the US and Germany. I'm currently in Texas but I'm happy to fly out for any engagement which requires a personal touch. 

Get in touch if you're interested in having asymetric power in your next business or personal engagement.
