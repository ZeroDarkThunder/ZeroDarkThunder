Moin Moin, I'm Tyler Italiano

I am a Hacker for hire. I have a masters degree in cyber security, graduated eight months early from a two year program in Germany, I have won challenge coins at Defcon 32 for an oustanding individual performance. I have been coding for 11 years and my expertise is social engineering and malware authoring but I'm happy to perform any objective, given the right price.

Get in touch if you're interested in having asymetric power in your next business or personal engagement.
